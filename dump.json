However, sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the correct order. \nTo rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.\nSome arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has been achieved.\n\nHowever, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the correct place, then carriage B, and so on.\n\nUsing four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall call maximix arrangements, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for DACB is shown below.\n\n\n\n\nIt can be verified that there are 24 maximix arrangements for six carriages, of which the tenth lexicographic maximix arrangement is DFAECB.\n\nFind the 2011th lexicographic maximix arrangement for eleven carriages.\n\n",

    "problemText": "\n\nOn the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point A(0, 1) to point B(d, 1) for an integer d.\n\n\nIn each step, the ant at point (x0, y0) chooses one of the lattice points (x1, y1) which satisfy x1  0 and y1  1 and goes straight to (x1, y1) at a constant velocity v. The value of v depends on y0 and y1 as follows:\n\n If y0 = y1, the value of v equals y0.\n If y0  y1, the value of v equals (y1 - y0) / (ln(y1) - ln(y0)).\n\n\n\nThe left image is one of the possible paths for d = 4. First the ant goes from A(0, 1) to P1(1, 3) at velocity (3 - 1) / (ln(3) - ln(1))  1.8205. Then the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205  1.2283.\nFrom P1(1, 3) to P2(3, 3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the required time is 2 / 3  0.6667. From P2(3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant travels at velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3))  1.8205 so the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205  1.2283.\nThus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.\n\n\nThe right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as 0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052. It can be shown that this is the quickest path for d = 4.\n\n\n\nLet F(d) be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest path.
